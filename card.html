        <img src="img/IMG_Mihu.png" alt="Cute memory" class="card-img">
        <p> Every moment with you feels special to me! Sometimes, I wonder if it’s selfish of me to want to hold on to all those moments forever. I’ve always loved photography and capturing beautiful memories, yet I feel like I haven’t taken enough photos of those moments — and that’s something I truly regret. I hope that one day, we can have more memories together and capture them, so I’ll always have those little pieces of happiness to look back on. 📸❤️
